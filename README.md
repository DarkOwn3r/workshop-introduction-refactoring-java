# Workshop introduction refactoring in Java

> Use **Maven** to open this project and copy the contents of the file corresponding to the installed Java version (`java8-pom.xml` or `java11-pom.xml`) into the `pom.xml` file.

In this repository you will find the first 3 exercises of our course of advanced refactoring:

- **Exercise 1:**

  The aim of this exercise is for you to understand how values and references work in Java. You must complete the tests in the file `youShouldUnderstandValuesAndReferences.java` , getting them to pass.


- **Exercise 2:**

  In this second exercise, you must change the price attribute of the shopping cart to a price list:

  `List<Integer> prices;`

  You must make sure that the tests keep passing.


- **Exercise 2 - Second iteration:**

  When you have the price list, you must change the type of the variable from integer to a Price object.


- **Exercise 3:**

  You must convert the Id parameter to a value object. Remember to check that the tests are green.
